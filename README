Working on writing a detailed README... until then here are some of my ramblings.

## Stereo Project Thoughts
Need to set up organization for project(s)
List of Projects:
- PCBs - group as single repo, ~~single kicad project~~, multiple projects bc messy w/ multiple sheets
	- Audio
	- Main (Raspberry Pi carrier)
	- Power (Car communications)
- CarPlay
	- react-carplay - will be using this initially
	- carplay-rs - in very initial stage of development
- CAD
	- Malibu Stereo faceplate for RPi touchscreen
	- Malibu Stereo adapter for better touchscreen


Order of prioritization
1. PCB - Power
2. PCB - Audio
3. CAD - Faceplate
4. CarPlay (working on getting rpi booting up to react-carplay first)
